# AI Testing Quest: Machine Learning Metrics with Python
Welcome to the **AI Testing Quest** GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to the code created during my YouTube live sessions where I explore and learn about testing AI/ML systems. This journey is about learning, failing, succeeding, and sharing my experiences with the community.

## About This Repository
In my very first YouTube live session, I will be exploring machine learning metrics using Python. This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources used during the session. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, I hope you'll find this content useful and engaging as we dive into the world of AI/ML together.

## YouTube Channel
Join me on my YouTube channel, **AI Testing Quest**, where I'll be streaming live sessions, sharing tutorials, and discussing various topics related to AI/ML testing.
